Tasks

    0. Placeholders

        Write the function def create_placeholders(nx, classes): that returns two placeholders, x and y, for the neural network:

        nx: the number of feature columns in our data
        classes: the number of classes in our classifier
        Returns: placeholders named x and y, respectively
            x is the placeholder for the input data to the neural network
            y is the placeholder for the one-hot labels for the input data

    1. Layers

        Write the function def create_layer(prev, n, activation):

        prev is the tensor output of the previous layer
        n is the number of nodes in the layer to create
        activation is the activation function that the layer should use
        use tf.contrib.layers.variance_scaling_initializer(mode="FAN_AVG") to implement He et. al initialization for the layer weights
        each layer should be given the name layer
        Returns: the tensor output of the layer

    2. Forward Prop

        Write the function def forward_prop(x, layer_sizes=[], activations=[]): that creates the forward propagation graph for the neural network:

        x is the placeholder for the input data
        layer_sizes is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the network
        activations is a list containing the activation functions for each layer of the network
        Returns: the prediction of the network in tensor form
        For this function, you should import your create_layer function with create_layer = __import__('1-create_layer').create_layer

    3. Accuracy

        Write the function def calculate_accuracy(y, y_pred): that calculates the accuracy of a prediction:

        y is a placeholder for the labels of the input data
        y_pred is a tensor containing the networkâ€™s predictions
        Returns: a tensor containing the decimal accuracy of the prediction
        hint: accuracy = correct_predictions / all_predictions
